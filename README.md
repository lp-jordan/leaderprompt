# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Electron API

The preload script exposes an `electronAPI` object on `window` for renderer processes. Alongside other helpers, you can listen for live script updates with:

```javascript
window.electronAPI.onScriptUpdated((html) => {
  // handle updated HTML
});
```

This pairs with `sendUpdatedScript(html)` to keep the prompter view in sync.

When running the Electron app in development, the main process now waits for the
Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173` to respond before creating any
windows. This avoids reload loops while Vite is starting.

## OpenAI Rewrite Feature

LeaderPrompt can suggest alternative phrasings for selected text using OpenAI's
API. The feature looks for an API key at startup and disables itself if none is
available. The rewrite panel also supports an optional style modifier: click
**Add style** to reveal a text field where you can describe the desired tone
(for example, "formal" or "playful"). The modifier is sent with rewrite
requests to the model. Use the â†» button to re-run a request if you want a fresh
set of suggestions.

### Local development

Create a `.env` file in the project root containing:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

Restart the development server after adding the file.

### Packaged builds

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before launching the application:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key LeaderPrompt.app
```

Alternatively, create `~/leaderprompt/config.json` with:

```
{ "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-your-key" }
```

If the key is missing, the app logs an error and rewrite options are hidden.

## Script Persistence

Edits made in the script editor are automatically written back to the underlying
`.docx` file. The main process converts the edited HTML using
`html-to-docx` and saves it to the selected project/script location via the new
`save-script` IPC handler exposed as
`window.electronAPI.saveScript(projectName, scriptName, html)`.

## Packaging and Releases

Run `npm run package` on a Mac to build the application. Electron Builder will
generate `dmg` and `zip` files in the `release` directory. Releases are
published to GitHub so the app can receive updates through `electron-updater`.

Packaged apps use icons from the `build/icons` directory. Provide
`icon.ico` for Windows and `icon.icns` for macOS in that folder before
running `npm run package`.

## API Key Management

LeaderPrompt requires an OpenAI API key for rewrite features. The app reads the
key from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable at runtime.

### Local Development

Store the key in `~/.config/leaderprompt/openai_api_key` and start the app with:

```bash
npm start
```

The bootstrap script loads the key from that file and launches the Electron
process with the environment variable set, keeping the key outside the project.

### CI/CD and Packaging

CI pipelines should supply `OPENAI_API_KEY` from a centrally managed secret
store. The included GitHub Actions workflow uses a repository secret named
`OPENAI_API_KEY`. Rotate this secret centrally without modifying the codebase.
